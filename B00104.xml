            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>? <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Keber?</hi> And if they bee one thing in signification, I desire Testimonies, of authenticke Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in the fore-sayde Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which holde this Opinion?</p>
            <p>If they be not one thing in sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, what moveth you to translate, agaynst all Antiquitie, yea, agaynst an Article of our <hi>Creed,</hi> That CHRIST His Soule was in the Graue?</p>
            <p>For we belieue, that CHRIST descended vnto Hell, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His Bodie, (because indeed it was in a new Monument buried by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 23.53</note> as the Scripture witnesseth) therefore according to His Soule, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180951:11"/> went downe, to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, to deliver the Patriarchs, and the Iust, which were there detayned captiue. And this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending can not be to the <hi>Graue,</hi> because Saynct <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.9.</note> That Hee descended first to the lower parts of the earth; which is a place opposite to that where He ascended when Hee led Captivitie captiue; and is called in our <hi>Creed</hi> by the Apostles, <hi>Hell;</hi> and by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>The heart of the earth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.40.</note> For as <hi>Ionas</hi> was three dayes and three nights in the Whales bellie, so shall the Sonne of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. But <hi>the heart of the earth</hi> was not the <hi>Graue;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as Saynct <hi>Ierome</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">Hierom. in cap. <hi>2.</hi> Ionae.</note>
               <hi>Sicut cor in medio est anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, ita infernus in medio terrae esse perhibetur.</hi> And in another
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180951:12"/> place,<note place="margin">Idem, in cap. <hi>4.</hi> ad Ephes.</note>
               <hi>Inferiora terrae infernus accipitur, ad quem DOMINVS noster Salvat√≥rque descendit, ut sanctorum animas, quae ibi tenebantur inclusae secum ad coelos victor abduceret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More-over; This place where-vnto CHRIST descended, can not be <hi>Heaven;</hi> because wee say not, that CHRIST descended into <hi>Heaven;</hi> but that Hee ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and led Captivitie captiue: which was the Patriarchs and Prophets, and the Iust, which died before CHRISTS suffering, and were not glorified, till the pryce of our Redemption was payed, by putting out, as Saynct <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, the Hand-wryting of Ordinances,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.14.</note> that was agaynst vs, which was contrarie to vs; Hee even tooke it out of the way, and fastened it vpon the Crosse, &amp;c. They were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180951:12"/> not then glorified before that tyme, because all those, as Saynct <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.39.</note> through Fayth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned good report, and rcceived not the Promise; GOD provyding a better thing for vs, that they without vs should not bee made perfect. And the reason is which Saynct <hi>Paul</hi> giveth, saying, That the way vnto the Holiest of all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8.</note> was not yet opened, while as yet the first Tabernacle was stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for which cause the same Apostle sayeth, That the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the holie Place, that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.19.</note> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> is a new way: but it had not beene a new way, if anie had entered before CHRIST our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Where-by it is evident, that CHRIST was the first that ascended, when He led Captivitie captiue, &amp;c. And also, that Hee descended first to the lower parts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180951:13"/> of the earth; <hi>Ut educeret vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos suos de lacu, in quo non erat aqua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 9.11.</note> as <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sayeth.</p>
            <p>Farther: This descending of CHRIST vnto Hell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>instit. cap.</hi> 6. ¬ß. 10.</note> can not bee vnderstood of the suffering of the paynes of Hell speciallie vpon the Crosse, according to <hi>Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> blasphemous doctrine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in all the Scripture there is no mention made of such suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.7.</note> and Saynct <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, that the Blood of CHRIST cleangeth vs from all sinne: and Saynct <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.7.</note> We haue redemption through His Blood, even the forgiuenesse of sinnes, according to His rich Grace: and therefore I <hi>demaund,</hi> Whether suffered CHRIST vp≈ç the Crosse, <hi>Poenam damni,</hi> or <hi>sensus,</hi> or both?</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:180951:13"/>
            <p>Hee suffered not the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause His Soule was ever blessed: Hee suffered not the second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Hee suffered not vpon the Crosse the payne of Fyre, nor vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Darknesse, in aeternall Bands: neyther suffered Hee the Worme which dieth not; nor Hee was not in Hell, in companie with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirits, where is weeping, and gnashing of Teeth: for these are the paynes of Hell, where-of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie: If He suffered both <hi>poenam damni,</hi> and <hi>sensus,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Scripture for the same: for, according to Theologues, all the paynes of Hell are comprehended vnder these two tearmes, <hi>Poena damni, &amp; sensus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finallie: It can not bee sayde, that when the Scripture sayeth, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my Soule
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180951:14"/> in Hell;</hi> that it is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,<note place="margin">In his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1556.</note> as <hi>Beza</hi> interpreteth it, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case in the Graue:</hi> because the <hi>Soule,</hi> is not the <hi>Carcase;</hi> and <hi>Graue,</hi> is not <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There-after, the <hi>Soule</hi> in that place, can not bee taken for the <hi>Bodie;</hi> because it is distinguished from the <hi>Bodie,</hi> where-of it is sayde, that it shall not see Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Act 2.27.</note> nor was His <hi>Soule</hi> in <hi>Graue</hi> at anie tyme of those three dayes, where-in Hee descended vnto <hi>Hell;</hi> except immediatelie before His Glorious Resurrection.</p>

                     <p>First, then, for Scripturall proofe. In the 88. <hi>Psalme,</hi> that same which is <hi>Sheol</hi> in the thirde verse, is called <hi>Keber</hi> in the 5. and 11. verses: which <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> testifieth to bee true, by expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both to bee <hi>Sepulchrum,</hi> or the <hi>Graue.</hi> There-fore, <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Keber</hi> are both of one signification.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. verse 7. the Prophet sayeth, <hi>Our Bones are scattered at the mouth of</hi> Sheol.

                     <p>Lyke-wyse, in all the praecee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding places, where-in wee proved a-before, <hi>Hades</hi> to bee put for the <hi>Graue,</hi> the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> Text hath <hi>Sheol.</hi> Whence wee inferre, That

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondlie, For proofe out of Popish Expounders of Scripture, that <hi>Sheol</hi> signifieth the <hi>Graue,</hi> as well as <hi>Keber,</hi> and so, consequentlie, that both are of one signification, <hi>Lyra</hi>'s wordes are cleare, saying, <hi>In Hebreo pro Inferno ponitur</hi> SHEOL,<note place="margin">Lyra, in Psal. <hi>114.</hi>

                     <p>Agayne: The <hi>Hebrew</hi> worde SHEOL, properlie signifieth the <hi>Graue,</hi> (sayeth both <hi>Iansenius,</hi> on <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.12. and <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> in his Aunswere to <hi>Leo √† Castro</hi>) and <hi>Hell,</hi> metaphoricallie.

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:180951:30"/> to rest, or leane in the Bosome, was a signe of moste speciall loue, Advauncement, and nearest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of familiaritie; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did denotate in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> not onelie his happie Admission, and Assumption, vnto that Heavenlie Estate; but also his high Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there-in, and nearest Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the moste excellent and rarest Saynctes of GOD, (such as ABRAHAM was) in the joyfull par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation with them of the satietie of Blisse, in that Heavenlie King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: So that, for this cause, the happie estate of <hi>Lazarus</hi> Soule in Glorie, is so compared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and called, <hi>Abraham's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</hi>

                        <hi>that the metaphore</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>is taken from those, who sit downe at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, whose order was this; That to whom-so-ever one sate nearest,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180951:31"/> hee did leane in his Bosome; even as Saynct</hi> Iohn <hi>is sayde to haue leaned in</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>Bosome, at the last Supper. There-fore, because that which is in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, is as it were moste neare and deare vnto vs; and hee who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth anie, taketh then most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when hee leaneth in their Bosome, whome hee loveth: as</hi> Iohn <hi>doeth show the same; who, when hee had sayde,</hi> There was a certayne Disciple, who leaned in IESUS Bosome; <hi>as it were for explications sake, hee addeth,</hi> whom IESUS loved. <hi>Hence, there-fore, it is,</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>that the Bosome is taken for the place of greatest pleasure, and of nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest conjunction, with the person beloved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing, there-fore, this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore is taken from banquetting, (as both Scripture showeth, and

And if ABRAHAM him-selfe, in opposing the estates of these two after death, cleareth not vnto vs, That as the ritch Glutton had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, before, received his good thinges, in his lyfe; so had LAZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVS, even then, received his good thinges, after his death, saying, <hi>Now hee is comforted, and thou tormented.</hi> Which speach coulde not haue beene true, if LAZARVS, in anie hellish <hi>Limbus,</hi> had beene depryved of the Vision of GOD;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:180951:32"/> for, so, LAZARVS had beene affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and not comforted; seeing (as sayeth SALOMON) that hope,<note place="margin">Prov. 13.12</note> which is differred, afflicteth the Soule: and <hi>Dives</hi> alone, also, had not beene in torment; because (as their owne <hi>Adrian Florentinus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) this punishment of losse,<note place="margin">Adrian.

                     <p>Having, then, set downe the reason, why the bliss-full estate of the Godlie, after death, is called Abraham's Bosome, which over-turneth <hi>Limbus;</hi> wee haue next to consider, where it is: vvhere-anent, if wee consult <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi>

                     <p>For farther resolution of which poynt, AVGVSTINE'S wordes may suffice, in his 99. <hi>Epistle,</hi> to <hi>Evodius;</hi> where hee sayeth, That hee found not what profite could redound, by <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> Descense vnto <hi>Hell,</hi> to the just Men, which were in ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM'S Bosome; from whome hee could never see, that the <hi>LORD</hi>

                     <p>If the PATRIARCHES, and just Men, were al-readie happie in their Soules, before <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and in ABRAHAM'S Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, (which is Heaven, as is formerly proven) and there injoyed the blessed Vision of GOD conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie, without getting anie newe benefit or profit, by <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to <hi>Hell:</hi> then it will folow, that they were not in anie infernall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Hell,</hi> captivated, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that blessed Presence, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, till by <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> Descense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hell,</hi> they were liberate, and, so, received that Benefite, or profite, there-by.</p>
                     <p>But, according to AVGVSTINE his Testimonie, they were al-readie happie in their Soules, both for Place, (beeing in Heaven) and for Presence, (enjoying the Vision of GOD.)</p>
                     <p>There-fore, they were not in

                     <p>Besides, if wee consider the Prayses, which GOD'S Mouth gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to those His oddest Servants; and the rare Testimonies,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.19. 2.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:180951:37"/> and vncharitable conceit, agaynst Scripturall evidence, and Reason, to incarcerate such heavenlie livers on earth, so long after death, in an hellish Prison.</p>
                     <p>What a store, also, of constant and glorious Martyres, haue beene amongst them? Of whome it is witnessed, That the Worlde was not worthie to haue such into it, for the short tyme of their lyfe.

                     <p>There resteth onelie, then, to finde out, what is meaned by PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RADISE; where-by wee may more clearlie vnderstand, whither the Soule of <hi>CHRIST</hi> went, after His paynefull Suffering: Where-in, first, wee shall showe, out of the Apostle, That PARADISE spoken of in the GOSPELL, is the thirde Heaven, and Mansion-place of aeternall Blessednesse. And, this wee shall confirme, lyke-wyse, out of <hi>Romanists</hi> them-selues.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, That this PARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DISE, which is the thirde Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is that same thing, which was promised vnto the Thiefe vpon the Crosse.</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:180951:39"/>
                     <p>Thirdlie, that this which was promised to the Thiefe, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a blessed estate of Soule, but, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in that same Place of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where the Soules of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, with GOD, and His Angels, haue their perpetuall Abode.

                     <p>First, then, the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the aboundance of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were given vnto him, hee telleth vs,<note place="margin">2.

Showing, here-by, both these, to bee one. There-fore, sayeth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> wryting vpon that place, <hi>Non oportet nos aliud intellige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re per Coelum, &amp; aliud per Paradisum; sed unum &amp; idem per utrumque:</hi> that is, <hi>Wee must not vnderstand ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing by</hi> Heaven, <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>Agayne: How was not the Soule of <hi>CHRIST</hi> destitute of the bliss-full Vision of GOD, at least in the consequence there-of, which is the sense of heavenlie joy, when Hee complayneth, that Hee was <hi>forsaken?</hi> which could not befall to one that still had enjoyed that Vision, and that sort there-of which they want, who are sayde to suffer <hi>poenam damni:</hi> which Vision, is that perfect and cleare sight of GOD, in the Heavens with joy, where the Soule is subject to no evill of paine; where-of the Psalmist, in <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> Person,<note place="margin">Psal. 87. <hi>Aquin. part.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 15. <hi>a.</hi> 4.</note> proclaimed his soule, to haue beene full, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> doeth show.</p>
